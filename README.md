üèòÔ∏è Neighborhood Asset Sharing API
Project Title: Community Resource Sharing API
The Neighborhood Asset Sharing API is a Django REST Framework (DRF) backend designed to facilitate local, community-level resource sharing. It connects neighbors, enabling them to easily lend and borrow household items, tools, books, and appliances, fostering sustainability and collaboration within the community.

This API serves as the robust backend for a potential web or mobile application, handling all data management, user authentication, and lending logic.

üåü Key Features
The API provides RESTful endpoints for the core functionalities:

User Management: Secure user registration, authentication (planned for Week 4), and profile management.

Item Management: CRUD operations for items, including details like condition, description, and availability status.

Lending/Borrowing System (In Progress): Logic to handle lending requests, approval/denial, and tracking returns.

Availability Calendar (In Progress): System for owners to mark specific blackout dates for their items.

Messaging System (Planned): Basic internal messaging for users to coordinate logistics.
